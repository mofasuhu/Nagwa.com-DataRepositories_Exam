    <p>In this explainer, we will learn how to construct and calculate the equilibrium 
      constant for concentration.</p>
    <p>We can quantify the equilibrium that exists between reactants and products in 
      terms of their concentrations by calculating and using the equilibrium constant <latex>$@K_@c$</latex>. 
      The equilibrium constant for concentration expresses a value related to the ratio 
      between the concentration of the reactants and the concentration of the products 
      at equilibrium. The equilibrium constant, as the name implies, relates to a 
      closed system that does not allow any matter exchange with its surroundings; 
      therefore, the concentrations of the products and reactants do not change once 
      the system is at equilibrium.</p>
    <sidebar type="definition">
      <title>Definition: Closed System</title>
      <p>It is a system that does not exchange matter but can exchange energy with its surroundings.</p>
    </sidebar>
    <p>In its simplest form, the equilibrium constant for concentration, <latex>$@K_@c$</latex>, can 
      be written as
      <latex>\begin{align*}@K_@c=\frac{[\text{@products}]}{[\text{@reactants}]}.\end{align*}</latex></p>
    <p>If we extend this to the general equation
      <chem style="displayed">\ch{A + B &lt;=&gt; C + D}</chem>
      in which an equilibrium is formed between two reactants, <chem style="inline">\ch{A}</chem> and
      <chem style="inline">\ch{B}</chem>, and two products, 
      <chem style="inline">\ch{C}</chem> and <chem style="inline">\ch{D}</chem>, then <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> 
      would be written as follows:
      <chem style="displayed">@K_@c =\frac{\ch{[C][D]}}{\ch{[A][B]}}.</chem></p>
    <p>Remember that, in chemistry, we use square brackets to indicate concentration, 
      which is most commonly measured in moles (M), 
      <quantity type="long"><value></value><unit>mole per decimeter^3</unit></quantity> 
      (<quantity><value></value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>), 
      or <quantity type="long"><value></value><unit>mole per liter</unit></quantity> 
      (<quantity><value></value><unit>mole per liter</unit></quantity>).</p>
    <p>When writing equations for <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> from actual chemical equations, it is essential to 
      take note of the stoichiometry. Let’s look closely at the equation for <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> for the 
      equilibrium between nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide:
      <chem style="displayed">{\textcolor{Red}{2}}\ch{NO2(\textit{g}) &lt;=&gt;  N2O4(\textit{g})} \quad
        @K_@c=\frac{\ch{[N2O4]}}{\ch{[NO2]}^{\textcolor{Red}{2}}}</chem></p>
    <p>We can see that the concentration of nitrogen dioxide is raised to the power of 
      two and that this mirrors the value of the stoichiometric coefficient of nitrogen 
      dioxide in the original chemical equation. In a slightly more complicated example 
      that reinforces this point, the common equilibrium reaction that occurs as part 
      of the Haber process in the generation of ammonia has an equilibrium constant 
      for concentration expressed as
      <chem style="displayed">\ch{N2(\textit{g}) + }\textcolor{Red}{3} \ch{H2(\textit{g}) &lt;=&gt;}
        \textcolor{Blue}{2} \ch{NH3(\textit{g})} \quad
        @K_@c=\frac{\ch{[NH3]}^{\textcolor{Blue}{2}}}{\ch{[H2]}^{\textcolor{Red}{3}}\ch{[N2]}}</chem></p>
    <sidebar type="definition">
      <title>Definition: Equilibrium Constant for Concentration</title>
      <p>For the equation 
        <chem style="displayed">\ch{$@a$A + $@b$B &lt;=&gt; $@c$C + $@d$D}</chem>
        the equilibrium constant for concentration, <latex>$@K_@c$</latex>, is the product of the 
        concentrations of <chem style="inline">\ch{C}</chem> and <chem style="inline">\ch{D}</chem> 
        divided by the product of the concentrations

      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>At its simplest level, we know that <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> is the equilibrium constant for 
          concentration and that, like all equilibrium constants, it is represented in 
          some fashion by the products being divided by the reactants. We know that in 
          this general reaction equation, the products are <chem style="inline">\ch{C}</chem> and 
          <chem style="inline">\ch{D}</chem>; therefore, we 
          immediately know that we can discount answers C, D, and E.</p>
        <p>We also know that when writing the equilibrium constant of the concentration, 
          each of the concentrations of the reactants and the products is raised to 
          the power of its stoichiometric coefficient. Answer A has the stoichiometric 
          coefficients multiplied by the concentrations, whereas answer B has 
          concentrations raised to the powers of the stoichiometric coefficients, 
          which is what we are looking for. Hence, answer B is the correct answer.</p>

    <p>It is important to note that some questions may involve a chemical reaction in 
      which one of the products and/or reactants may be in the solid phase. In this 
      case, the chemical species in the solid phase is not included in the value for 
      <latex>$@K_@c$</latex>, nor is the concentration of pure water when used as a solvent 
      (<chem style="inline">\ch{H2O(\textit{l})}</chem>).</p>

        <mcq>
          <stem>
            <p>Silver ions can be reduced by iron(II) ions in the net ionic equation
              <chem style="displayed">\ch{Fe^{2+}(\textit{aq}) + Ag+ (\textit{aq}) &lt;=&gt; Fe^3+ (\textit{aq}) + 
                Ag (\textit{s})}</chem></p>
            <p>What is the correct equation for <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> for this reaction?</p>
          </stem>
        </mcq>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>When writing the equation for <latex>$@K_@c$</latex>, we must initially follow the overall principle 
          of writing <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> equations, which is that the product of the concentrations of the 
          products should be divided by the product of the concentrations of the reactants.</p>
        <p>However, in this particular chemical reaction, we must be mindful of the state 
          symbols of each of the different chemical species. The silver product is solid 
          silver metal and should not be included in the equation for <latex>$@K_@c$</latex>, as the effective 
          concentration of a solid stays constant throughout the reaction.</p>
        <p>As such, the only product in this reaction that is included in the expression 
          for <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> is the concentration of iron(III) ions, which should be divided by the 
          product of the concentration of iron(II) ions and silver ions. Hence, the 
          correct answer is
          <chem style="displayed">@K_@c = \frac{\ch{[Fe^{3+}]}}{\ch{[Fe^{2+}][Ag^+]}}.</chem></p>

    <p>At higher levels, the discussion of a topic known as dimensionality explains why 
      equilibrium constants are often being expressed without a unit, but that is 
      beyond the scope of this explainer.</p>
    <p>However, in certain cases, units for <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> may need to be calculated. As such, it is 
      important to be able to multiply and divide 
      <quantity type="long"><value></value><unit>mole per decimeter^3</unit></quantity> 
      (<quantity><value></value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>) 
      or <quantity type="long"><value></value><unit>mole per liter</unit></quantity> 
      (<quantity><value></value><unit>mole per liter</unit></quantity>) as well as understand what happens to these values 
      when they are raised to different powers. Let’s examine again the reaction 
      between nitrogen and hydrogen. The <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> equation in question is
      <chem style="displayed">@K_@c = \frac{\ch{[NH3]^2}}{\ch{[H2]^3}\ch{[N2]}}.</chem></p>
    <p>Given the equation for <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> above, the final unit would be resolved as follows:
      <latex>\begin{align*}\frac{\left(<quantity><value></value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>\right)^2}{\left(<quantity><value></value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>\right)^3 \left(<quantity><value></value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>\right)}=\frac{<quantity><value></value><unit>mole^2 decimeter^-6</unit></quantity>}{<quantity><value></value><unit>mole^4 decimeter^-12</unit></quantity>}=\frac{1}{<quantity><value></value><unit>mole^2 decimeter^-6</unit></quantity>}=<quantity><value></value><unit>mole^-2 decimeter^6</unit></quantity>.\end{align*}</latex></p>

      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>When concentrations are represented using square brackets in chemistry, 
          we can assume that the unit we are discussing is 
          <quantity type="long"><value></value><unit>mole per decimeter^3</unit></quantity> 
          (<quantity><value></value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>) or <quantity type="long"><value></value><unit>mole per liter</unit></quantity> (<quantity><value></value><unit>mole per liter</unit></quantity>), unless we are told otherwise.</p>
        <p>In this equation, the unit of the products on top is raised to the power of 
          2, whereas the units at the bottom are multiplied by each other. We can see 
          in the equation below how these units would cancel out, meaning that answer 
          A, “No unit,” is the correct answer:
          <latex>\begin{align*}\frac{\left(<quantity><value></value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>\right)^2}{\left(<quantity><value></value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>\right) \left(<quantity><value></value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>\right)}=\frac{<quantity><value></value><unit>mole^2 decimeter^-6</unit></quantity>}{<quantity><value></value><unit>mole^2 decimeter^-6</unit></quantity>} @longrightarrow \text{@nounit}.\end{align*}</latex></p>
      </answer>
    </example>
    <p>In terms of actually calculating <latex>$@K_@c$</latex>, there are a variety of ways in which the 
      calculation could be attempted. For example, a question may give you all the 
      concentrations required, meaning that all that would be left to do would be 
      to input the data into the <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> equation.</p>
    <p>Let’s imagine that during the production of ammonia, the equilibrium mixture 
      contains  <quantity><value>0.982</value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity> of 
      <chem style="inline">\ch{NH3 (\textit{g})}</chem> and <quantity><value>0.193</value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity> 
      of each <chem style="inline">\ch{H2 (\textit{g})}</chem> and 
      <chem style="inline">\ch{N2 (\textit{g})}</chem>. 
      The reaction is
      <chem style="displayed">\ch{N2 (\textit{g}) + 3 H2 (\textit{g}) &lt;=&gt; 2 NH3 (\textit{g})}</chem></p>
    <p>So, the equation for <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> must be
      <chem style="displayed">@K_@c= \frac{\ch{[NH3]^2}}{\ch{[H2]^3}\ch{[N2]}}.</chem></p>
    <p>If we substitute the correct numbers into the equation, we can simply calculate 
      the value of <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> as follows:
      <chem style="displayed">@K_@c=\frac{\ch{[NH3]^2}}{\ch{[H2]^3 [N2]}}
        =\frac{[0.982]^2}{[0.193]^2[0.193]}=
        <quantity><value>695</value><unit>mole^-2 decimeter^6</unit></quantity>.</chem></p>
    <p>When calculating <latex>$@K_@c$</latex>, it is important to ensure that the correct information is 
      extracted from the question. The numbers that need to be used in the calculation 
      should be concentrations, so it may be necessary to calculate the concentration 
      from information in the question before calculating <latex>$@K_@c$</latex>.</p>
    <p>It may also be the case that all the values needed at equilibrium are not given, 
      but initial values of concentrations or moles are given instead. In this 
      situation, a table is often the most sensible way to clearly and carefully 
      calculate the numbers that will need to eventually be put into the <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> equation. 
      One popular method of creating a table is known as the ICE method, which we will 
      use here; however, there are others.</p>
    <p>Hydrogen sulfide can be decomposed by heat according to the equation
      <chem style="displayed">\ch{2 H2S (\textit{g}) &lt;=&gt; 2 H2 (\textit{g}) + S2 (\textit{g})}</chem><quantity><value>0.50</value><unit>mole</unit></quantity> of hydrogen sulfide is heated at a steady temperature in a container of 
      volume 
      <quantity><value>2.0</value><unit>decimeter^-3</unit></quantity> 
      until an equilibrium in which <quantity><value>0.38</value><unit>mole</unit></quantity> of 
      <chem style="inline">\ch{H2S}</chem> still remains is 
    reached.</p>

      <tr>
        <th></th>

        <td>0.00</td>
        <td>0.00</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>In the first row of the table above, we put the “Initial,” which gives us the 
    letter I. These are the values from the start of the experiment before the 
    reaction takes place and equilibrium is reached.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Change, C</th>
        <td>
          <latex>$-\textcolor{Blue}{2}@x$</latex>

        </td>
        <td>
          <latex>$+@x$</latex>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Equilibrium, E
          (Moles at Equilibrium)</th>
        <td>0.38</td>
        <td>0.12</td>
        <td>0.06</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Next, we fill out the next two rows, “Change” and “Equilibrium.” The change 
      <latex>$@x$</latex> is 
    multiplied by the stoichiometric coefficient from the reaction equation
      <chem style="displayed">\textcolor{Blue}{2}\ch{H2S (\textit{g}) &lt;=&gt;} \textcolor{Purple}{2}
        \ch{H2 (\textit{g}) + S2 (\textit{g})}</chem></p>
    <p>We can consider the change in the reactants to be negative and the change in 
    the products to be positive, hence the positive and negative values in the 
    row “Change.”</p>
    <p>We are told that <quantity><value>0.38</value><unit>mole</unit></quantity> of 
      <chem style="inline">\ch{H2S}</chem> remains at equilibrium; therefore, 
    <quantity><value>0.12</value><unit>mole</unit></quantity> must have been converted. 
      We now know that
      <latex>\begin{align*}-2@x = <quantity><value>-0.12</value><unit>mole</unit></quantity>.\end{align*}</latex></p>
    <p>From here, we can calculate that <latex>$2@x = <quantity><value>0.12</value><unit>mole</unit></quantity>$</latex> and 
      <latex>$@x = <quantity><value>0.06</value><unit>mole</unit></quantity>$</latex>.</p>

    <p>In the final row of the table, we use the volume, given to us in the question, to 
      calculate the concentration at equilibrium.</p>
    <p>With this information, we can calculate <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> as follows:
      <chem style="displayed">@K_@c=\frac{\ch{[H2]^2 [S2]}}{\ch{[H2S]^2}}
        =\frac{0.004^2\times 0.002}{0.016}
        =<quantity><value>2.00\times 10^{-6}</value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>.</chem></p>
    <p>It is also possible that a question may provide you with the amount of substance but 
    not the volume. At first, this may cause you to quite rightly think that there is 
    no solution, as concentration cannot be calculated without a volume. However, 
    in these cases, the volumes will often cancel out, making them an unnecessary 
    piece of information. This can be seen in the following example.</p>
    <p>In this example, <quantity><value>0.50</value><unit>mole</unit></quantity> of 
    hydrogen gas and <quantity><value>0.40</value><unit>mole</unit></quantity> of iodine 
    gas are heated and an equilibrium is allowed to establish. The equilibrium mixture 
    contains <quantity><value>0.64</value><unit>mole</unit></quantity> of hydrogen iodide:
      <chem style="displayed">\ch{H2 (\textit{g}) + I2 (\textit{g}) &lt;=&gt; 2 HI (\textit{g})}</chem></p>
    <p>Again, using the ICE method, the following table can be completed.</p>

          <latex>$0.64/@V$</latex>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Now, we have the values to substitute into the <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> equation as follows:
      <chem style="displayed">@K_@c=\frac{\ch{[HI]^2}}{\ch{[H2][I2]}}
        =\frac{[0.64/@V]^2}{[0.18/@V][0.08/@V]}
        =\frac{[0.64]^2}{[0.18][0.08]}=28.44.</chem></p>
    <p>Using the examples above, we can see how we are able to calculate values of <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> or 
    use values of <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> to calculate concentrations of products or reactants at 
    equilibrium. Furthermore, it is vitally important that we have some 
    understanding of what the value of <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> is telling us, now that we have 
    quantified it.</p>
    <p>If the value of <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> is greater than one 
      <latex>$\left(@K_@c &gt; 1\right)$</latex>, we know that the equilibrium lies 
    to the right-hand side and that the equilibrium favors the products 
    (forward reaction). If the value of <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> is less than one 
      <latex>$\left(@K_@c &lt; 1\right)$</latex>, we know that the 
    equilibrium lies to the left-hand side and favors the reactants (backward reaction). 
    While the manner in which the value of <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> increases or decreases is not always 
    linear, generally, the greater or smaller the value of <latex>$@K_@c$</latex>, the further the 
    equilibrium lies in favor of either the products or the reactants.</p>

      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>At first inspection, it may appear that we are missing a lot of information 
          in this question. How could we possibly start to calculate <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> for the second 
          equation with no information about concentrations? However, if we look 
          closely, we will see that the second reaction is, in fact, the reverse 
          reaction of the first equation. If we were to write out the equations for <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> 
          for both of these equations, they would be as follows.</p>
        <p>For equation 1,
          <chem style="displayed">@K_@c=\frac{\ch{[SO3]^2}}{\ch{[SO2]^2 [O2]}}.</chem></p>
        <p>For equation 2,
          <chem style="displayed">@K_@c=\frac{\ch{[SO2]^2 [O2]}}{\ch{[SO3]^2}}.</chem></p>
        <p>As we can see, the second value of <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> is, in fact, the reciprocal of the 
          first equation. As the temperature is the same, we can find the 
          reciprocal of 32, which will give us the value of <latex>$@K_@c$</latex> for the second 
          equation. Remember, however, that we also need to find the reciprocal of 
          the units. So, our final answer would be as follows:
          <latex>\begin{align*}@K_@c = <quantity><value>\frac{1}{32}</value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>
            = <quantity><value>0.03125</value><unit>mole decimeter^-3</unit></quantity>.\end{align*}</latex></p>
