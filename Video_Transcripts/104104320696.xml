  <title>Relating Force, Pressure, and Area</title>
  <seo_meta_description>In this video, we will learn how to use the formula for pressure, 𝑃 = 𝐹/𝐴, to calculate pressures that are produced by forces acting on areas.</seo_meta_description>
  <transcript>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:00:00.110" end_time="00:00:05.670">In this video, we will be looking
                at how to define pressure and how it relates to the concept of force and area.</s>
      <s start_time="00:00:06.020" end_time="00:00:08.870">So let’s start by first of all
                imagining that we have a box.</s>
      <s start_time="00:00:09.060" end_time="00:00:12.870">And inside this box, we have a
                single particle of some gas inside it.</s>
      <s start_time="00:00:13.150" end_time="00:00:19.790">Let’s also imagine that this
                particle is moving around inside the box at a velocity 𝑉 and is basically bouncing
                around inside the box.</s>
      <s start_time="00:00:19.910" end_time="00:00:27.750">Now, let’s also assume that the
                particle continues to bounce around inside the box with the same speed even though
                its direction is changing every time it collides with a wall of the box.</s>
    </p>
	
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:00:27.980" end_time="00:00:34.030">And with all of that in mind, let’s
                consider one particular collision between the particle and the right-hand side wall
                of the box.</s>
      <s start_time="00:00:34.280" end_time="00:00:38.390">So let’s zoom in to this region
                here, where the particle is colliding with the wall of the box.</s>
      <s start_time="00:00:38.690" end_time="00:00:39.990">So here’s the zoomed-in
                version.</s>
      <s start_time="00:00:40.020" end_time="00:00:45.010">Now we said earlier that the
                particle initially was travelling with a velocity 𝑉 in this direction.</s>
      <s start_time="00:00:45.270" end_time="00:00:49.210">And then, after the collision, the
                particle is travelling with a velocity 𝑉 in this direction.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:00:49.650" end_time="00:01:01.870">Now if the magnitude or size of the
                velocity of the particle before the collision and after the collision are exactly
                the same or in other words it travels at 𝑉 before the collision and 𝑉 after the
                collision, then the particle can’t have lost any energy.</s>
      <s start_time="00:01:02.110" end_time="00:01:03.890">This is an assumption that we’re
                making here.</s>
      <s start_time="00:01:03.890" end_time="00:01:06.560">We’re assuming that the particle
                doesn’t lose kinetic energy.</s>
      <s start_time="00:01:07.000" end_time="00:01:13.760">So the size or magnitude of the
                particle’s velocity does not change after the collision, but the direction of the
                velocity does change.</s>
      <s start_time="00:01:13.880" end_time="00:01:17.660">And one thing that we can do is to
                break up the velocity of the particle into components.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:01:17.910" end_time="00:01:22.400">Initially, the particle is
                travelling at some velocity to the right and some velocity upward.</s>
      <s start_time="00:01:22.730" end_time="00:01:27.360">And after the collision, the
                particle is travelling at some velocity to the left and some velocity upward.</s>
            <s start_time="00:01:27.740" end_time="00:01:36.440">Now in a collision where the particle
                is not losing energy and there’s nothing affecting the upward velocity of the
                particle, we can say that the upward component of the velocity stays the same.</s>
      <s start_time="00:01:37.200" end_time="00:01:41.540">Of course, in the diagram that
                we’ve drawn, they don’t look exactly identical, but they’re meant to be.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:01:41.690" end_time="00:01:52.310">However, what is changing because
                of the collision is the right left component of the velocity because initially the
                right left component of the velocity was in this direction and then after the
                collision, it’s now in this direction.</s>
      <s start_time="00:01:52.810" end_time="00:02:03.820">This means that the net result of
                the collision with the wall is that the particle’s velocity is changing in this
                direction or we can also say that Δ𝑉 — the change in velocity of the particle — is
                towards the left.</s>
      <s start_time="00:02:04.000" end_time="00:02:11.260">This is because the right left
                component of the particle’s velocity was such that it was initially travelling
                towards the right and then after the collision it’s travelling towards the left.</s>
      <s start_time="00:02:11.470" end_time="00:02:14.400">So its velocity in the left
                direction has increased.</s>
      <s start_time="00:02:14.660" end_time="00:02:17.750">And we’ve called that change in
                velocity in the leftward direction Δ𝑉.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:02:18.210" end_time="00:02:23.980">Now in addition to this, we can
                realize that the particle’s collision with the wall takes a certain amount of
                time.</s>
      <s start_time="00:02:24.230" end_time="00:02:30.220">As the particle comes in towards
                the wall and then bounces off, it spends a certain period of time actually colliding
                with the wall.</s>
      <s start_time="00:02:30.460" end_time="00:02:34.100">Now this period of time might be
                very very short, but it is a period of time nonetheless.</s>
      <s start_time="00:02:34.250" end_time="00:02:38.450">And we can call that period of time
                when the particle is colliding with the wall Δ𝑡.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:02:39.160" end_time="00:02:48.090">Now since the velocity of the
                particle is changing by Δ𝑉 and it does this over a time interval Δ𝑡, we can
                therefore work out the rate of change of the particle’s velocity.</s>
      <s start_time="00:02:48.400" end_time="00:02:53.210">We can say that the particle
                changes in velocity by Δ𝑉 over a time interval Δ𝑡.</s>
      <s start_time="00:02:53.510" end_time="00:02:58.960">And at this point, we can realize
                that this quantity that we’re calculating is known as the acceleration of the
                particle 𝑎.</s>
      <s start_time="00:02:59.240" end_time="00:03:03.520">And this is because acceleration is
                defined as the rate of change of velocity of an object.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:03:03.830" end_time="00:03:08.200">Now as well as this, we can say
                that the particle itself has a mass which we’ll call 𝑚.</s>
      <s start_time="00:03:08.540" end_time="00:03:15.560">And then we can recall that when an
                object with a certain mass undergoes an acceleration, there must have been some net
                force acting on that object.</s>
      <s start_time="00:03:15.750" end_time="00:03:23.890">The reason is because of Newton’s
                second law of motion: the force on an object 𝐹 is equal to the mass of that object
                𝑚 multiplied by its acceleration 𝑎.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:03:24.140" end_time="00:03:33.780">And therefore, we can realize that
              in order for that to be a change in velocity of the particle towards the left, the
                particle must have experienced the force towards the left exerted by the wall during
                the collision.</s>
      <s start_time="00:03:34.270" end_time="00:03:35.720">We can call this force 𝐹.</s>
      <s start_time="00:03:35.910" end_time="00:03:45.940">And we can use Newton’s second law
                of motion to work out that the force 𝐹 is equal to the mass of the particle which
                we’ve called 𝑚 multiplied by the acceleration of the particle which was Δ𝑉 divided
                by Δ𝑡.</s>
      <s start_time="00:03:46.910" end_time="00:03:50.690">That’s the change in velocity
                divided by the time interval over which that velocity changes.</s>
      <s start_time="00:03:50.920" end_time="00:03:54.470">So that’s the force exerted on the
                particle by the wall in the collision.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:03:54.830" end_time="00:03:57.720">But then at this point, we can
                recall Newton’s third law of motion.</s>
      <s start_time="00:03:57.830" end_time="00:04:08.410">Newton’s third law of motion tells
                us that if an object which we’ll call A exerts a force on a second object B, then
                the second object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A.</s>
      <s start_time="00:04:08.770" end_time="00:04:14.470">Now in our scenario where the
                particle is colliding with the wall, the wall is exerting a force 𝐹 on the
                particle.</s>
      <s start_time="00:04:14.600" end_time="00:04:21.840">And therefore, by Newton’s third
                law of motion, the particle must be exerting an equal-in-magnitude force but in the
                opposite direction on the wall.</s>
      <s start_time="00:04:22.130" end_time="00:04:27.720">And so, from this, what we can
                realize is that the particle colliding with the wall results in a force being
                exerted on the wall.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:04:28.090" end_time="00:04:31.570">Now at this point, we can zoom back
                out and think about our entire box once again.</s>
      <s start_time="00:04:31.740" end_time="00:04:37.140">And instead of just one particle
                inside the box, let’s think about the box being filled up with lots of particles of
                gas.</s>
      <s start_time="00:04:37.340" end_time="00:04:42.090">Now each one of these particles is
                moving around inside the box at different velocities and different directions.</s>
      <s start_time="00:04:42.440" end_time="00:04:45.730">And they’re all colliding with the
                walls of the box and bouncing around inside the box.</s>
      <s start_time="00:04:46.010" end_time="00:04:51.850">But then, we’ve just seen that
                every time a particle collides with the wall of the box, it exerts a force on the
                wall of the box.</s>
      <s start_time="00:04:52.100" end_time="00:05:00.250">And furthermore, if we now think
                about the fact that the box is a three-dimensional object, we can see that each wall
                of the box has a particular area, which we shall call 𝐴.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:05:00.910" end_time="00:05:07.480">Now over time as the particles of
                gas move around inside the box, lots of them will collide with this particular wall
                of the box which has an area 𝐴.</s>
      <s start_time="00:05:07.650" end_time="00:05:10.550">And each collision is going to
                exert a particular force on the wall.</s>
      <s start_time="00:05:10.850" end_time="00:05:15.900">Now let’s say that we add up all of
                the forces exerted by the particles on the wall every time they collide with the
                wall.</s>
      <s start_time="00:05:16.110" end_time="00:05:17.800">And let’s call this force 𝐹.</s>
      <s start_time="00:05:18.110" end_time="00:05:19.320">Now let’s not get confused
                here.</s>
      <s start_time="00:05:19.510" end_time="00:05:23.450">Earlier, we used 𝐹 to define the
                force exerted by one particle colliding with the wall.</s>
      <s start_time="00:05:23.620" end_time="00:05:30.480">But now we’re adding up all of the
                forces exerted by the particles colliding with that particular wall of the box and
                calling that total force 𝐹.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:05:30.740" end_time="00:05:44.180">So if we take this total force
                exerted by all of the particles colliding with the wall and we can do this for any
                particular instant in time and we can divide that force by the area of the wall
                itself 𝐴, which will bring us to the definition of a quantity called the
                pressure.</s>
      <s start_time="00:05:44.550" end_time="00:05:51.720">In other words, this force per unit
                area is known as the pressure exerted by the gas particles on this particular wall
                which has an area 𝐴.</s>
      <s start_time="00:05:52.190" end_time="00:05:54.100">And that is the definition of
                pressure.</s>
      <s start_time="00:05:54.360" end_time="00:05:56.590">It is equal to the force per unit
                area.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:05:56.700" end_time="00:06:02.580">And at this point, we should note
                that it’s not only gases that can exert a pressure, even solids and liquids can
                exert pressures.</s>
      <s start_time="00:06:02.880" end_time="00:06:16.790">For example, if you were to place
                your hand on a table and pushed downwards onto the table with a certain force 𝐹,
                then your hand would be exerting a pressure on the table which would be equivalent
                to the force 𝐹 divided by the area of contact between your hand and the table.</s>
      <s start_time="00:06:17.050" end_time="00:06:19.880">So solids, liquids, and gases can
                exert pressures.</s>
      <s start_time="00:06:19.880" end_time="00:06:22.510">And pressure is defined as the
                force per unit area.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:06:22.690" end_time="00:06:32.580">As well as this, the unit for
                pressure is the pascal, short form Pa, where one pascal is equivalent to one newton
                — that’s the unit of force — divided by one meter squared — that’s the unit of
                area.</s>
      <s start_time="00:06:33.270" end_time="00:06:38.530">So now that we’ve had a look at the
                definition for pressure, let’s get some practice using this with an example
                question.</s>

      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time="00:06:52.430" end_time="00:06:59.910">Okay, so in this question, we have
                a man who is standing on the ground and his feet have a total area of 0.025 meters

        <s start_time="00:07:00.090" end_time="00:07:05.530">In other words, the total area of

        <s start_time="00:07:05.770" end_time="00:07:10.280">So let’s say that the contact area,

                the force that the man will exert onto the floor.</s>
        <s start_time="00:07:24.190" end_time="00:07:40.560">And therefore, if we want to work
                out the pressure applied by the man’s feet to the ground, then we can recall that
                the pressure applied to in this case the ground is defined as the force applied by
                the man in this case to the ground divided by the total area of contact or
                specifically the area of the floor over which that force is distributed.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time="00:07:40.990" end_time="00:07:52.600">Now since we’re working in base
                units — we’ve been given the area of the man’s feet in meters squared and his weight
                in newtons — this means that when we calculate the pressure using this equation,
                we’ll actually find it in its own base unit which is the pascal.</s>
        <s start_time="00:07:53.290" end_time="00:07:56.900">However, there is a catch: we need
                to work out this pressure in kilopascals.</s>
        <s start_time="00:07:57.170" end_time="00:07:59.540">We’ll come to that later, but it’s
                good to be aware of it now.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time="00:07:59.740" end_time="00:08:09.740">So we can say that the pressure
                exerted by the man on the floor is equal to the force that he exerts which is 800
                newtons — that’s his weight — divided by the area over which that force is
                distributed.</s>
        <s start_time="00:08:09.880" end_time="00:08:18.180">That area is the same as the
                contact area between the man’s feet and the floor or in other words the area of the
                man’s feet which happens to be 0.025 meters squared.</s>
        <s start_time="00:08:18.540" end_time="00:08:24.730">Then, when we evaluate the
                right-hand side of this equation, we find that the pressure ends up being 32000
                pascals.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time="00:08:25.000" end_time="00:08:27.600">Now we need to convert this
                pressure into kilopascals.</s>
        <s start_time="00:08:27.810" end_time="00:08:34.870">To do this, we can recall that one
                pascal is equivalent to one thousandth of a kilopascal because the prefix kilo means
                1000.</s>
        <s start_time="00:08:35.180" end_time="00:08:40.390">So one thousandth of 1000 pascals
                is the same thing as one pascal.</s>
        <s start_time="00:08:40.640" end_time="00:08:46.600">And therefore, what this means is
                that 32000 pascals is the same thing as 32 kilopascals.</s>
        <s start_time="00:08:46.890" end_time="00:08:52.250">Hence, our final answer is that the

        <s start_time="00:08:56.280" end_time="00:09:01.030">A pressure of 20 pascals is applied
                by an 8000-newton force to a square area.</s>
        <s start_time="00:09:01.410" end_time="00:09:03.480">What is the length of a side of the

      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time="00:09:04.110" end_time="00:09:09.380">Okay, so in this question, we’ve
                got a square area, which we can draw something like this if we’re looking at it
                slightly side-on.</s>
        <s start_time="00:09:09.500" end_time="00:09:13.150">And we’ve been told that a force of
                8000 newtons is applied to this area.</s>
        <s start_time="00:09:13.340" end_time="00:09:15.780">This results in a pressure of 20
                pascals.</s>
        <s start_time="00:09:16.070" end_time="00:09:19.820">Now at this point, we can recall
                the relationship between pressure, force, and area.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time="00:09:20.140" end_time="00:09:26.350">Pressure is defined as the force
                per unit area or in other words the force exerted on an area divided by that
                area.</s>
        <s start_time="00:09:26.530" end_time="00:09:35.500">So using this equation, because we
                know that the pressure exerted on this blue area is 20 pascals and the force exerted
                is 8000 newtons, we can calculate the area.</s>
        <s start_time="00:09:35.780" end_time="00:09:40.630">We can do this by rearranging the
                equation for which we have to multiply both sides by 𝐴 divided by 𝑃.</s>
        <s start_time="00:09:41.390" end_time="00:09:45.170">In this case, the 𝑃s on the
                left-hand side cancel and the 𝐴s on the right-hand side cancel.</s>
        <s start_time="00:09:45.430" end_time="00:09:50.210">What this leaves us with is that
                area 𝐴 is equal to the force 𝐹 divided by the pressure 𝑃.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time="00:09:50.590" end_time="00:09:55.580">Therefore, we can plug in the
                values for the force which is 8000 newtons and the pressure which is 20 pascals.</s>
        <s start_time="00:09:55.720" end_time="00:10:03.170">And since we’re working in base
                units for both the pressure and the force, our answer ends up being 400 meters
                squared, where meter squared is the base unit of area.</s>
        <s start_time="00:10:03.450" end_time="00:10:07.350">So at this point, we’ve worked out
                that the total blue area is 400 meters squared.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time="00:10:07.630" end_time="00:10:10.820">However, what we’ve been asked to
                do is to find the length of one of the sides.</s>
        <s start_time="00:10:11.140" end_time="00:10:14.030">Luckily though, we’ve been told
                that this area is actually a square.</s>
        <s start_time="00:10:14.200" end_time="00:10:17.190">And hence, we know that the lengths

        <s start_time="00:10:17.270" end_time="00:10:21.890">So we can say that 𝑥 is the length
                of one of the sides and therefore it’s also the length of all of the sides.</s>
        <s start_time="00:10:21.930" end_time="00:10:29.080">Then, we can work out that the area
                of a square is found by multiplying its length by its width, which because it’s a
                square, it’s 𝑥 in both cases.</s>
        <s start_time="00:10:29.280" end_time="00:10:32.680">Therefore, we can say that the area

      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time="00:10:33.050" end_time="00:10:39.640">And hence, if we want to find the

                the square root of both sides.</s>
        <s start_time="00:10:39.860" end_time="00:10:42.660">This way, the square root on the

        <s start_time="00:10:42.900" end_time="00:10:47.490">And what we’re left with is that

                sides.</s>
        <s start_time="00:10:47.650" end_time="00:10:50.770">But then, we’ve just calculated the

        <s start_time="00:10:50.970" end_time="00:10:54.770">Therefore, the length of one of the

        <s start_time="00:10:54.990" end_time="00:10:59.590">And this ends up being 20 meters,

      <s start_time="00:11:05.870" end_time="00:11:15.510">Firstly, we saw that pressure is
                defined as the force exerted on an object per unit area or in an equation, we can
                say that the pressure 𝑃 is equal to the force 𝐹 divided by the area 𝐴.</s>
      <s start_time="00:11:15.910" end_time="00:11:20.480">Secondly, we saw that pressure can
                be exerted by a solid, liquid, or a gas.</s>
      <s start_time="00:11:20.750" end_time="00:11:23.590">There is no restriction to what

    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time="00:11:23.780" end_time="00:11:31.200">And lastly, we saw that pressure
                has units of Pa which stands for pascals, where one pascal is equivalent to one
                newton per one meter squared.</s>
      <s start_time="00:11:31.450" end_time="00:11:35.710">Or in other words, the unit of
                pressure is equivalent to the unit of force divided by the unit of area.</s>
      <s start_time="00:11:36.080" end_time="00:11:40.080">So this has been an overview on how
