            <s start_time ="00:00:04.030" end_time="00:00:13.180">As we’ll see, this is a method for
                taking two vectors that lie in the 𝑥- and 𝑦-plane and combining them to yield a
                third vector in the 𝑧-dimension.</s>

        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:00:13.720" end_time="00:00:17.770">To get started, we can recall that
                there are a number of ways of combining vectors.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:00:18.040" end_time="00:00:21.980">It’s possible to add vectors
                together or to subtract one from another.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:00:22.360" end_time="00:00:26.790">And we can also combine vectors
                using what’s called a scalar or dot product.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:00:27.240" end_time="00:00:39.830">In this lesson, we’re talking about
                vector products which are unique in that a vector product is a way of multiplying
                two vectors together so that a vector, a quantity with magnitude and direction,
                results.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:00:40.180" end_time="00:00:43.220">In other words, a vector product
                creates another vector.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:00:43.650" end_time="00:00:47.410">To see how this works
                mathematically, let’s give these two vectors names.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:00:47.650" end_time="00:00:51.760">Let’s say the vector in blue is
                vector 𝐀 and that in red is vector 𝐁.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:00:52.150" end_time="00:00:57.750">Without knowing anything more about
                𝐀 and 𝐁, we can write down a general rule for their vector product.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:00:58.110" end_time="00:01:05.180">We can represent the vector product
                of 𝐀 with 𝐁 this way, using an × or a cross in between the two vector symbols.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:01:05.470" end_time="00:01:10.830">Now, the equation we’re going to
                write applies specifically to vectors that lie in the 𝑥𝑦-plane.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:01:11.260" end_time="00:01:15.940">This means that we can write vector
                𝐀 and vector 𝐁 mathematically like this.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:01:16.130" end_time="00:01:21.760">We can represent 𝐀 as the sum of a
                component in the 𝑥-direction and a component in the 𝑦-direction.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:01:22.100" end_time="00:01:24.600">And we can represent vector 𝐁 in a
                similar way.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:01:25.260" end_time="00:01:30.030">And note these vector symbols that
                apply in our definitions for vectors 𝐀 and 𝐁.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:01:30.290" end_time="00:01:33.740">In both cases, we have a vector
                called 𝐢 and a vector called 𝐣.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:01:34.030" end_time="00:01:38.910">We can recall that these are unit
                vectors for the 𝑥- and 𝑦-axes, respectively.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:01:39.180" end_time="00:01:46.460">Note, by the way, that when we
                include a third dimension and call it 𝑧, the unit vector for that dimension is
                typically represented by the letter 𝐤.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:01:46.780" end_time="00:01:55.770">Anyway, when we write 𝐀 and 𝐁 in
                terms of their components this way, we’re then able to take the next step and fill
                out the right-hand side of this vector product equation.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:01:56.150" end_time="00:01:59.510">We do that using the 𝑥- and
                𝑦-components of 𝐀 and 𝐁.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:01:59.840" end_time="00:02:07.300">If we take the 𝑥-component of 𝐀,
                that’s this component here, and multiply it by the 𝑦-component of 𝐁, that’s this
                component here.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:02:07.620" end_time="00:02:13.540">And then, subtract from that the
                𝑦-component of 𝐀 here times the 𝑥-component of 𝐁 here.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:02:13.860" end_time="00:02:17.880">Then we will have the correct
                expression for the magnitude of our vector product.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:02:18.130" end_time="00:02:21.930">But remember we said that a vector
                product results in another vector.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:02:22.240" end_time="00:02:24.730">And that’s where this 𝐤 unit
                vector comes in.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:02:24.980" end_time="00:02:30.350">This gives the magnitude of 𝐀 𝑥
                times 𝐁 𝑦 minus 𝐀 𝑦 times 𝐁 𝑥 a direction.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:02:30.680" end_time="00:02:32.960">So indeed, we are calculating a
                vector.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:02:33.140" end_time="00:02:34.940">And notice something about that
                direction.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:02:35.210" end_time="00:02:45.020">While 𝐀 and 𝐁 were both entirely
                in the 𝑥𝑦-plane and, therefore, had only 𝐢- and 𝐣-components, the vector product
                of 𝐀 and 𝐁 is entirely in a different dimension.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:02:45.060" end_time="00:02:46.300">It’s in the 𝐤-direction.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:02:46.670" end_time="00:02:52.880">It’s always the case that a vector
                product of two vectors is perpendicular to those two original vectors.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:02:53.300" end_time="00:02:57.670">Now, let’s get some practice
                applying this equation using these two vectors here.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:02:58.050" end_time="00:03:01.660">Say that we locate 𝐀 and 𝐁 on a
                set of coordinate axes.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:03:01.730" end_time="00:03:07.390">And we label the 𝑥- and 𝑦-axes
                using these numbers, but we don’t specify the units they represent.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:03:07.740" end_time="00:03:11.330">For our purposes, those units
                aren’t important, so we’ll leave them undefined.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:03:11.760" end_time="00:03:17.410">Studying these axes, we can see
                that vector 𝐀 has an extension of one unit in the 𝑥-direction.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:03:17.620" end_time="00:03:20.720">And then, it extends five units in
                the positive 𝑦-direction.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:03:21.010" end_time="00:03:25.030">This means we can write 𝐀 as 𝐢
                plus five times 𝐣.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:03:25.390" end_time="00:03:32.300">Likewise, with vector 𝐁, we see
                that this extends four units in the positive 𝑥-direction and two units in the
                positive 𝑦.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:03:32.690" end_time="00:03:36.130">So, 𝐁 is equal to four times 𝐢
                plus two times 𝐣.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:03:36.480" end_time="00:03:41.520">Now that we know the 𝑥- and
                𝑦-components of 𝐀 and 𝐁, we can calculate their vector product.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:03:41.820" end_time="00:03:44.680">Specifically, let’s calculate 𝐀
                cross 𝐁.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:03:45.080" end_time="00:03:57.000">We see, based on our vector product
                equation, that this is equal to the 𝑥-component of 𝐀, that’s one in our case,
                times the 𝑦-component of 𝐁, that’s equal to two based on our definition of vector
                𝐁.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:03:57.330" end_time="00:04:06.420">And then, from this, we subtract
                the 𝑦-component of 𝐀, that’s equal to five, multiplied by the 𝑥-component of 𝐁,
                and that is equal to four.</s>

        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:04:06.840" end_time="00:04:22.270">And just as we saw for our general
                vectors that lay in the 𝑥𝑦-plane, so these specific vectors 𝐀 and 𝐁 whose
                components we know, according to this set of coordinate axes, will yield a vector
                product that points either in the positive or the negative 𝐤-direction.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:04:22.510" end_time="00:04:26.410">In other words, this vector product
                will point somewhere along the 𝑧-dimension.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:04:26.820" end_time="00:04:30.190">And it will have no component in
                the 𝑥- or 𝑦-dimensions.</s>
        </p>
        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:04:30.550" end_time="00:04:35.450">So then, looking at this equation,
                we can now calculate what’s inside the parentheses in blue.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:04:35.910" end_time="00:04:37.330">One times two is two.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:04:37.330" end_time="00:04:38.950">And five times four is 20.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:04:39.180" end_time="00:04:43.970">So, we have two minus 20 or
                negative 18𝐤 as a resulting vector.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:04:44.390" end_time="00:04:53.630">On our coordinate axes then, if we
                represented the negative 𝑧-direction using this dashed line, then the vector
                product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 would point 18 units along that line.</s>

        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:04:53.980" end_time="00:04:57.980">Now, there’s something very

            <s start_time ="00:04:58.100" end_time="00:05:01.560">And that is that the order of the
                vectors we use is very important.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:05:01.930" end_time="00:05:11.670">Notice in this equation that when
                we cross 𝐀 with 𝐁, 𝐀 coming first, then it’s the 𝑥-component of that first
                vector which multiplies the 𝑦-component of the second one.</s>
            <s start_time ="00:05:11.780" end_time="00:05:16.090">And then, in the next term, the

            <s start_time ="00:05:16.410" end_time="00:05:25.970">If we were to reverse these two
                vectors at the outset — instead of taking 𝐀 cross 𝐁, we take 𝐁 cross 𝐀 — then we
                would calculate a different result on the right-hand side.</s>

        <p>
            <s start_time ="00:05:26.240" end_time="00:05:28.310">To see that that’s so, let’s do
                this.</s>

            <s start_time ="00:05:47.170" end_time="00:05:51.170">But if we’re careful about it,
