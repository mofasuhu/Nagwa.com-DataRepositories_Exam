    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:00:02.580" end_time="00:00:09.090">In this video, we‚Äôre going to look
                at an application of trigonometry to calculating angles of elevation and
                depression.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:00:12.060" end_time="00:00:16.960">So, first of all, let‚Äôs clarify
                what is meant by angles of elevation and angles of depression.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:00:17.120" end_time="00:00:22.380">And the two diagrams here are
                useful in explaining it, angles of elevation, first of all.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:00:23.590" end_time="00:00:28.300">So, we have here a diagram of a
                person and they are looking up at an object above them.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:00:28.790" end_time="00:00:36.900">The angle of elevation is the angle
                formed between the horizontal and that person‚Äôs line of sight as they‚Äôre looking up
                towards this object.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:00:38.400" end_time="00:00:44.180">An angle of depression is a similar
                concept, but this time our observer is looking down at something.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:00:44.480" end_time="00:00:52.890">So, the angle of depression is the
                angle formed again between the horizontal and the observer‚Äôs line of sight as they
                look down towards an object.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:00:54.610" end_time="00:01:05.460">In fact, if I were to add in
                another person, as I‚Äôve done in this diagram on the right, then the angle of
                elevation from the observer below and the angle of depression from the observer
                above are the same.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:01:05.460" end_time="00:01:09.330">They‚Äôre congruent to each other
                because the two horizontals are parallel.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:01:09.520" end_time="00:01:14.450">And therefore, these two angles are
                alternate interior angles in parallel lines.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:01:16.380" end_time="00:01:26.660">So, a lot of questions about angles
                of elevation and depression tend to be worded questions, where you need to read a
                description, interpret it, and I would always suggest drawing a diagram to help.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:01:26.820" end_time="00:01:28.550">So, we‚Äôll see some examples of
                this.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:01:30.980" end_time="00:01:32.590">So, here is our first question.</s>

      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:01:32.940" end_time="00:01:37.540">It says Tom stands on a cliff
                    100 metres high and sees a boat out at sea.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:01:38.070" end_time="00:01:42.200">The angle of depression from
                    Tom to the boat is 51 degrees.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:01:42.680" end_time="00:01:46.090">Calculate the distance between
                    the boat and the base of the cliff.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:01:48.030" end_time="00:01:52.880">So, as I mentioned, a diagram
                    is always a useful starting point to visualize the situation here.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:01:54.530" end_time="00:01:55.880">So, here is my diagram.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:01:55.880" end_time="00:02:01.050">I have a cliff with Tom on it
                    and a boat out at sea and Tom is looking down towards the boat.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:02.550" end_time="00:02:05.180">Now, we‚Äôre told the angle of
                    depression is 51 degrees.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:05.180" end_time="00:02:07.910">So, I also need to draw in the
                    horizontal.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:07.910" end_time="00:02:11.610">Because, remember, the angle of
                    depression is measured from the horizontal.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:13.210" end_time="00:02:14.680">So, there‚Äôs the horizontal.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:14.820" end_time="00:02:18.270">And the angle of depression
                    we‚Äôre told is 51 degrees.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:18.270" end_time="00:02:20.210">So, I need to label that
                    here.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:02:21.790" end_time="00:02:26.250">Now, if I want to use
                    trigonometry to approach this problem, then I need a right-angled triangle.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:26.380" end_time="00:02:32.230">So, I‚Äôm also going to add in a
                    vertical line that is parallel to the cliff from the boat to the horizontal.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:33.370" end_time="00:02:36.410">So, this gives me the
                    right-angled triangle that I‚Äôm going to work with.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:37.170" end_time="00:02:38.560">Now, we have some other
                    information.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:38.560" end_time="00:02:42.470">We‚Äôre told that the cliff Tom
                    standing on is 100 metres high.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:44.160" end_time="00:02:48.720">So that means I can label this
                    measurement here as 100 metres.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:02:50.160" end_time="00:02:54.110">Now, it‚Äôs just worth pointing
                    out we haven‚Äôt accounted for Tom‚Äôs height in any way.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:54.110" end_time="00:02:57.790">Obviously, Tom is on top of the
                    cliff, so he‚Äôs gonna be adding a little bit to this.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:58.160" end_time="00:03:00.410">But we haven‚Äôt been told how
                    tall Tom is.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:00.600" end_time="00:03:03.390">So, in this question, we‚Äôre
                    ignoring Tom‚Äôs height.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:03.720" end_time="00:03:12.400">In another question, it‚Äôs
                    possible that you might be told how tall Tom is or how high up his eyes are from
                    the ground, in which case you‚Äôd need to account for that as well.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:12.430" end_time="00:03:16.580">But in this question, we‚Äôre
                    just treating it as the 100 metres for the height of the cliff.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:03:18.630" end_time="00:03:22.570">Now, we‚Äôre asked to calculate
                    the distance between the boat and the base of the cliff.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:24.290" end_time="00:03:28.890">So, that is this horizontal
                    distance here, which I‚Äôve labelled as ùëë metres.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:30.630" end_time="00:03:34.380">So, thinking about how to
                    approach this problem then, it‚Äôs a trigonometry problem.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:34.530" end_time="00:03:43.390">And the first step for me when
                    approaching a trigonometry question is always to label the sides as the
                    opposite, the adjacent, and the hypotenuse in relation to the angle.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:43.440" end_time="00:03:45.930">So, that‚Äôs in relation to the
                    51 degrees here.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:03:47.810" end_time="00:03:49.210">So, there are their labels.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:49.380" end_time="00:03:52.810">And I can see I‚Äôve been given
                    the opposite and I want to know the adjacent.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:53.000" end_time="00:03:54.290">So, I‚Äôve got O and A.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:54.290" end_time="00:03:56.610">So, I‚Äôm going to be using the
                    tangent ratio here.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:57.350" end_time="00:04:00.980">I need to recall then what the
                    definition of the tangent ratio is.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:04:02.620" end_time="00:04:09.830">And the definition, remember,
                    is that tan of ùúÉ, where ùúÉ represents an angle, is the ratio of the opposite
                    divided by the adjacent.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:04:11.610" end_time="00:04:17.580">So, what I‚Äôm gonna do is I‚Äôm
                    gonna write this ratio out again, but I‚Äôm gonna fill in the information that I
                    know for this question.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:04:17.790" end_time="00:04:27.490">So, I‚Äôm gonna replace ùúÉ with
                    51 degrees, I‚Äôm gonna replace the opposite with 100, and I‚Äôm gonna replace
                    adjacent with ùëë cause that‚Äôs the letter I‚Äôve given it in this question.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:04:29.120" end_time="00:04:32.990">So, I have tan of 51 is equal
                    to 100 over ùëë.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:04:33.860" end_time="00:04:37.390">Now, looking to solve this
                    equation in order to work out the value of ùëë.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:04:37.720" end_time="00:04:45.040">ùëë is currently in the
                    denominator of a fraction, so the first thing I‚Äôm gonna do is I‚Äôm gonna multiply
                    both sides of the equation by ùëë.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:04:46.730" end_time="00:04:51.370">And this gives me ùëë multiplied
                    by tan 51 is equal to 100.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:04:52.370" end_time="00:04:58.310">Now, the next step to getting
                    ùëë on its own here is to divide both sides of the equation by tan 51.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:04:59.620" end_time="00:05:03.110">Tan 51 is just a number, so I
                    can do that without any problems.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:05:04.600" end_time="00:05:08.990">And so, this gives me ùëë is
                    equal to 100 over tan 51.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:05:10.650" end_time="00:05:13.970">Now, at this point, I‚Äôm gonna
                    reach for my calculator in order to evaluate that.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:05:14.280" end_time="00:05:20.420">And as that 51 was measured in
                    degrees, I need to make sure my calculator is in degree mode for this
                    question.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:05:22.030" end_time="00:05:25.930">So, evaluating that gives me
                    80.9784 for ùëë.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:05:26.150" end_time="00:05:28.390">I haven‚Äôt been told how to
                    round my answer.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:05:28.670" end_time="00:05:31.140">So, in this case, I‚Äôm gonna
                    round it to the nearest metre.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:05:32.520" end_time="00:05:38.460">So, this tells me that the
                    distance between the boat and the base of the cliff is 81 metres to the nearest
                    metre.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:05:40.620" end_time="00:05:44.020">So, really important to draw a

        <s start_time ="00:05:44.350" end_time="00:05:49.000">Read the information in the

      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:06:44.960" end_time="00:06:50.640">So, as before, it‚Äôs a
