      <s start_time ="00:00:02.690" end_time="00:00:07.820">In this video, we’re gonna look at
                what happens when you add or subtract vectors to or from each other.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:00:08.560" end_time="00:00:18.140">We know that vectors can be
                represented by line segments with a specific length and direction, and using these
                will really help us to visualise vector addition and subtraction.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:00:21.140" end_time="00:00:34.600">The addition process amounts to
                laying vectors end-to-end and calculating the components of the resultant vector by
                examining the difference between the coordinates of the initial point of the first
                vector and the terminal point of the last vector in the chain.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:00:37.450" end_time="00:00:38.780">So let’s see an example of
                that.</s>

      <question_title>Adding Components of Two Vectors in 2D</question_title>
      <question_seo_meta_description>𝑎 = 〈3, 2〉, 𝑏 = 〈4, −1〉, find 𝑎 + 𝑏.</question_seo_meta_description>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:00:39.300" end_time="00:00:44.910">We’ve got 𝑎 which is the
                    vector three, two and 𝑏 which is the vector four, negative one.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:00:45.240" end_time="00:00:47.360">And we want to add those two
                    vectors together.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:00:49.230" end_time="00:01:10.360">So just quickly sketching those
                    out, here we’ve got vector 𝑎 which has an 𝑥-component of positive three and a
                    𝑦-component of positive two — so we’ve gone three in that direction, two in
                    that direction — and 𝑏, which has an 𝑥-component of four and a 𝑦-component of
                    negative one.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:01:11.070" end_time="00:01:19.800">So if we add these two vectors,
                    it’s like laying them end to end and then working out how we get from the
                    beginning of the first vector to the end of the last vector.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:01:21.480" end_time="00:01:30.300">So to get from here to here,
                    we’ve taken a journey of three in the 𝑥-direction here and another four in the
                    𝑥-direction here.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:01:31.670" end_time="00:01:41.490">So to find the 𝑥-component of
                    the resultant vector, 𝑎 plus 𝑏, we simply add the 𝑥-component of 𝑎 to the
                    𝑥-component of 𝑏.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:01:43.560" end_time="00:01:45.470">And now let’s visit the
                    𝑦-components.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:01:45.470" end_time="00:01:54.000">So to get from here to here
                    again, we’ve done our positive two to take us up to the top of the diagram but
                    then we came back one.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:01:54.080" end_time="00:01:56.320">So we’ve got to add those two
                    components together.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:01:57.720" end_time="00:02:00.270">So that’s two plus negative
                    one.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:02.320" end_time="00:02:06.760">And three and four makes seven,
                    so the resultant 𝑥-component is seven.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:07.000" end_time="00:02:12.210">And two add negative one is
                    one, so the resultant 𝑦-component is one.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:02:13.430" end_time="00:02:20.270">So addition of vectors is just
                    a case of adding the 𝑥-components and adding the 𝑦-components.</s>
      </p>
    </question>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:02:23.700" end_time="00:02:25.840">Now let’s add three vectors
                together.</s>

      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:02:26.370" end_time="00:02:34.680">So we’ve got vector 𝑎, which
                    is four minus two; 𝑏 is one, six; and 𝑐 is negative five, negative four.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:34.710" end_time="00:02:37.350">And we’ve got to add all three
                    of those vectors together.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:02:37.730" end_time="00:02:39.680">So first let’s just sketch out
                    a diagram.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:40.960" end_time="00:02:48.620">Well here’s vector 𝑎 going
                    positive four in the 𝑥-direction and negative two in the 𝑦-direction.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:50.160" end_time="00:02:56.820">There’s 𝑏 going positive one
                    in the 𝑥-direction and positive six in the 𝑦-direction.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:02:59.660" end_time="00:03:09.870">And lastly we lay 𝑐 onto the
                    end of 𝑏, and we’ve got negative five in the 𝑥-direction and negative four in
                    the 𝑦-direction.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:11.520" end_time="00:03:21.380">And we can see that when we’ve
                    added 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐, the initial point of the first vector 𝑎 is in exactly the
                    same place as the terminal point of the last vector 𝑐.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:03:23.840" end_time="00:03:29.060">So although we’ve gone around
                    the houses, we started off here and we’ve ended up in exactly the same place
                    here.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:30.780" end_time="00:03:33.540">Okay let’s add those
                    𝑥-components together.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:33.870" end_time="00:03:37.830">So we’ve gone four and then
                    another one, and then we’ve taken away five.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:38.990" end_time="00:03:44.340">And in the 𝑦-direction, we
                    went negative two then added six and then finally took away four.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:45.510" end_time="00:03:51.960">And four add one take away five
                    is zero, and negative two add six take away four is also zero.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:03:53.870" end_time="00:03:58.030">So the resultant vector by
                    doing the adding up of the components is zero, zero.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:03:58.350" end_time="00:04:03.610">And that tallies with what we
                    knew at the beginning: that we started off and we ended in exactly the same
                    position.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:04:03.950" end_time="00:04:12.800">So the resultant vector, we
                    haven’t moved in the 𝑥-direction we haven’t moved in the 𝑦-direction; our
                    initial point and our terminal point are coincident.</s>
      </p>
    </question>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:04:14.770" end_time="00:04:23.560">Having looked at some basic
                addition of vectors, let’s take a quick look at repeated addition of vectors, or as
                it’s more properly called multiplying vectors by scalars.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:04:25.240" end_time="00:04:28.190">So let’s start up with 𝑎 is equal
                to the vector two, three.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:04:28.500" end_time="00:04:32.440">Let’s say we wanted to find out the
                what the value of two 𝑎 was.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:04:32.760" end_time="00:04:35.460">Well two 𝑎 is just 𝑎 plus 𝑎.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:04:36.780" end_time="00:04:43.260">And as we’ve just seen, to add two
                vectors together you just add the components together, so two plus two and three
                plus three.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:04:44.540" end_time="00:04:46.770">So yep we’re labouring the point
                here a little bit.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:04:47.000" end_time="00:04:52.030">But that means, we’ve got two lots
                of the 𝑥-component and two lots of the 𝑦-component, so this two here.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:04:52.060" end_time="00:04:58.300">We’ve multiplied each of the
                components by two, which gives us the vector four, six.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:05:00.050" end_time="00:05:04.500">Okay let’s think about three 𝑎
                now, so that’s 𝑎 plus 𝑎 plus 𝑎.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:05:04.850" end_time="00:05:06.780">Well I’m just gonna jump straight
                to the stage.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:05:06.780" end_time="00:05:18.310">When we’re multiplying the
                components, because it’s three 𝑎 we’re multiplying the 𝑥-component by three and
                the 𝑦-component by three, which gives us six, nine.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:05:20.420" end_time="00:05:24.660">And let’s just look at one more
                example: a fractional scalar, so a quarter.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:05:25.020" end_time="00:05:29.010">So a quarter of 𝑎, we’re just
                gonna multiply each component by a quarter.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:05:30.250" end_time="00:05:33.270">So that’s a quarter of two and a
                quarter of three.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:05:34.950" end_time="00:05:38.590">So that gives us a half and
                three-quarters as our components.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:05:40.360" end_time="00:05:52.350">So just to summarise that, the
                process of multiplying a vector by a scalar, we take the scalar and we just multiply
                each component of the vector by that scalar to get our components of the resultant
                vector.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:05:55.410" end_time="00:05:57.860">So let’s start off with the same
                vector 𝑎.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:05:57.860" end_time="00:06:02.180">And now let’s have a look at
                negative scalar multiplication, works in exactly the same way.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:06:02.240" end_time="00:06:03.860">So let’s just see a couple of
                examples.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:06:05.460" end_time="00:06:07.800">Okay we’re trying to find negative
                𝑎.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:06:07.840" end_time="00:06:15.510">That just means minus one times 𝑎,
                so we’re gonna take the scalar negative one and we’re gonna multiply both components
                by negative one.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:06:17.230" end_time="00:06:22.510">And that gives us an answer of
                negative two and negative three.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:06:25.610" end_time="00:06:28.670">And okay, let’s look at negative
                two 𝑎.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:06:30.190" end_time="00:06:37.360">So this time the scalar is negative
                two and we’re gonna multiply each of our 𝑥- and 𝑦-components by negative two.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:06:39.140" end_time="00:06:42.000">And that gives us an answer of
                negative four, negative six.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:06:44.000" end_time="00:06:58.490">Now it’s just worth taking a moment
                to notice 𝑎 and negative 𝑎: the components have the same numbers, two- two and two
                for the 𝑥-components and three and three for the 𝑦-components.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:06:58.780" end_time="00:07:02.520">But the in the negative 𝑎, the
                signs are the opposite signs.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:07:02.520" end_time="00:07:05.290">In fact, what we’re doing is we’re
                going exactly the opposite direction.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:07:06.760" end_time="00:07:14.610">So vector 𝑎, we’re going positive
                two in the 𝑥-direction and positive three in the 𝑦-direction; that’s this journey
                here.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:07:14.640" end_time="00:07:21.840">Negative 𝑎, we’re going negative
                two in the 𝑥-direction and negative three in the 𝑦-direction.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:07:23.340" end_time="00:07:29.370">So we’ve done the exact reverse
                journey in the neg- in the negative direction, in the opposite direction.</s>
      <s start_time ="00:07:29.670" end_time="00:07:37.720">So positive 𝑎 and negative 𝑎 are
                the same length of line, the same angle of vector, but they’re just going in the
                opposite direction.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s start_time ="00:07:40.200" end_time="00:07:44.810">Okay let’s look at a quick example
                or two of subtracting some vectors.</s>

      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:07:44.810" end_time="00:07:48.730">So we’ve got vector 𝑎 is two,

        <s start_time ="00:07:49.040" end_time="00:07:52.830">And we wanna calculate the

        <s start_time ="00:07:54.860" end_time="00:08:03.610">Well there’s different ways,
                    you could just take the 𝑥-components of 𝑎 and subtract the 𝑥-components of 𝑏
                    and the 𝑦-components of 𝑎 subtract the 𝑦-component of 𝑏 to get your
                    resultant.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:08:04.010" end_time="00:08:10.890">But I just like to suggest that
                    we look at it in this slightly different way so 𝑎 take away 𝑏 is the same as
                    𝑎 add the negative of 𝑏.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:08:11.620" end_time="00:08:24.930">So when we write that out,
                    we’ve got two plus the negative of four and we got three plus the negative of
                    negative one, which looks a bit on odd on the page.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:08:25.580" end_time="00:08:26.710">But there it is.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:08:27.890" end_time="00:08:36.070">So two add negative four is
                    negative two, and three add the negative of negative one, which is positive one,
                    makes four.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:08:38.020" end_time="00:08:45.950">Now this business of converting
                    𝑎 minus 𝑏 into 𝑎 plus the negative of 𝑏 seems like we’re overcomplicated
                    things.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:08:46.280" end_time="00:08:51.050">But let’s just take a look at
                    it visually first and see how that pans out.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:08:51.540" end_time="00:08:55.450">So we’ve got here vector 𝑎,
                    which I’m going across two and up three.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:08:56.770" end_time="00:09:03.200">So if I was adding 𝑏, I’d be
                    going right four and down one, but I’m adding the negative of 𝑏.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:09:03.230" end_time="00:09:09.560">So adding the negative of 𝑏
                    takes me from the end of 𝑎 left four, so we’re going four in that
                    direction.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:09:09.860" end_time="00:09:13.900">And the negative of negative

      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:09:15.060" end_time="00:09:31.300">So this idea of laying vectors
                    end to end, thinking of taking away 𝑏 as adding negative 𝑏, means we can just
                    lay down the negative vector to the end of 𝑎 and we can then look for this
                    resultant vector, going from the beginning of 𝑎 to the end of 𝑏 here.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:09:33.260" end_time="00:09:41.750">And when we do that, we were
                    going negative two in this direction and up here positive four in that
                    direction.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:09:42.690" end_time="00:09:54.770">So when subtracting vectors, we
                    can just subtract the components if you want to or we can add the negative of
                    the components for the second vector, which helps us to visualise the vector
                    diagram a bit more easily.</s>

                    calculate 𝑏 take away 𝑎, which is the same as 𝑏 add the negative of 𝑎, which

        <s start_time ="00:10:17.050" end_time="00:10:19.860">So that’s a resultant vector of

      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:10:19.860" end_time="00:10:21.790">Well let’s look at the diagram

        <s start_time ="00:10:23.170" end_time="00:10:39.750">Well first of all, vector 𝑏,
                    we’re going positive four in the 𝑥-direction and negative one in the
                    𝑦-direction and then adding the negative of 𝑎, that’s negative two in the

        <s start_time ="00:10:40.420" end_time="00:10:46.790">And negative of three so we’re

      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:10:48.050" end_time="00:10:55.160">So we start off at the initial

                    𝑎.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:10:55.460" end_time="00:10:58.100">So our resulting journey is

        <s start_time ="00:11:08.150" end_time="00:11:09.980">So this distance here is

        <s start_time ="00:11:20.830" end_time="00:11:29.160">So this vector here is 𝑏 take

      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:11:30.780" end_time="00:11:38.450">So just putting those two

                    was two negative four.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:11:38.800" end_time="00:11:43.580">So they were both in the same

      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:11:49.320" end_time="00:11:53.780">So they’re the same vector, but

        <s start_time ="00:11:54.980" end_time="00:12:00.080">So vector 𝑎 minus 𝑏 is the

        <s start_time ="00:12:00.080" end_time="00:12:07.730">And that makes sense because

                    𝑎.</s>

      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:12:17.850" end_time="00:12:28.330">We’ve got a regular hexagon
                    𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸𝐹 and 𝐺 is the midpoint of that and we have to express 𝐴𝐸 in terms
                    of vectors 𝑢 and 𝑣.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:12:28.360" end_time="00:12:34.170">So the vector 𝑣 is from 𝐺 to

        <s start_time ="00:12:34.870" end_time="00:12:39.060">Now because this is a regular

        <s start_time ="00:12:39.490" end_time="00:12:55.980">So 𝐴𝐵 and 𝐸𝐷 and 𝐹𝐺 and
                    𝐺𝐶 are all parallel; 𝐴𝐹 and 𝐵𝐺 and 𝐺𝐸 and 𝐶𝐷 are all parallel; and
                    𝐸𝐹, 𝐷𝐺, 𝐺𝐴, and 𝐶𝐵 are all parallel.</s>
      </p>
      <p>
        <s start_time ="00:12:56.760" end_time="00:13:05.780">So we know for example that

                    different places in there as well.</s>
        <s start_time ="00:13:07.410" end_time="00:13:11.060">So those distances are

        <s start_time ="00:13:16.670" end_time="00:13:26.680">And likewise, vector 𝑣,
                    running from 𝐺 to 𝐶, that will also be vector 𝑣; that will also be vector 𝑣;
                    and that will also be vector 𝑣.</s>

      </p>
      <p>
