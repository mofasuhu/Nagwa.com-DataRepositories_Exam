<p><s>The derivatives of a function give us many different techniques for describing the different properties of a curve. For example, 
      the slope of a curve is represented by its first derivative and the concavity of the curve is represented by its second derivative.</s></p>
<p><s>For a differentiable function <latex>$@f$</latex>, we know that the local extrema will occur when its derivative is equal to zero. 
      We can see this graphically, where the stationary points of <latex>$@y = @f\left( @x \right)$</latex> have the same <latex>$@x$</latex>-value as the

      We can also see this information graphically.</s></p><tikz scale="500" src="2.tex"/>
<p><s>This means we can analyze the curve <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> to determine information about the function 
      <latex>$@f$</latex>. When <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> has an <latex>$@x$</latex>-intercept, 
      <latex>$@f$</latex> must have a stationary point. In other words, the tangent line to <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> at this point is horizontal. 
      This could be a local extremum or it could be a point of inflection.</s></p>
<p><s>We know when <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is above the <latex>$@x$</latex>-axis, we can conclude <latex>$@f$</latex> is increasing. 
      Similarly, when <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is below the <latex>$@x$</latex>-axis, we can conclude <latex>$@f$</latex> is decreasing.</s></p>
<p><s>We can also do this with the second derivative. Recall that the second derivative of a function tells us the concavity of the curve.</s></p>

<p><s>When the curve <latex>$@y = @f@prime@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is above the <latex>$@x$</latex>-axis, the second derivative is positive,

<title>Finding the Monotonicity of a Function given Its Derivative Graph</title>
<question id="209189293038" instance_number="1">
<mcq>
<stem>
<p><s>The graph of the derivative <latex>$@f@prime$</latex> of a function <latex>$@f$</latex> is shown. On what intervals is <latex>$@f$</latex> 
              increasing or decreasing?</s></p><tikz scale="400" src="5.tex"/>
</stem>
</mcq>
</question>
<answer>
<p><s>In this question, we are given the curve of <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> and asked to find the intervals on which 
          <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> is increasing. Usually, we would look at the graph of <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> 
          and look for the portions of our graph where the slope is positive to see where the function is increasing and where the slope is 
          negative to see where the function is decreasing. To answer this question, we need to remember the slope of <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> 
          is given by <latex>$@f@prime \left( @x \right)$</latex>.</s></p>
<p><s>This means we can also see this information in the graph of <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex>. The derivative, 
          <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex>, will be positive when the curve is above the <latex>$@x$</latex>-axis and it will be negative 
          when the curve is below the <latex>$@x$</latex>-axis.</s></p><tikz scale="400" src="6.tex"/>
<p><s>We can see when <latex>$@x \in \nagwaInterval{(1,5)}$</latex> that we have <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right) &gt; 0$</latex>, 
          so the slope of <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> is positive. This means that, for these values of <latex>$@x$</latex>, our function 
          <latex>$@f$</latex> must be increasing.</s></p>
<p><s>Similarly, when <latex>$@x \in \nagwaInterval{(0,1)}$</latex> or <latex>$@x \in \nagwaInterval{(5,6)}$</latex>, we can see that 
          <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right) &lt; 0$</latex>, so the slope of <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> is negative for these values of 
          <latex>$@x$</latex>, which means that <latex>$@f$</latex> is decreasing on these intervals.</s></p>
<p><s>Therefore, we were able to show that <latex>$@f$</latex> is increasing on the interval <latex>$\nagwaInterval{(1,5)}$</latex> and decreasing on the intervals 
          <latex>$\nagwaInterval{(0,1)}$</latex> and <latex>$\nagwaInterval{(5,6)}$</latex>.</s></p>
</answer>
</example>
<p><s>It is worth noting that <latex>$@f@prime\left( 1 \right) =0$</latex> and <latex>$@f@prime\left( 5 \right) =0$</latex>. Since these values of 
      <latex>$@x$</latex> are the end points of increasing or decreasing intervals, we technically could include these values in our answer.</s></p>
<p><s>In fact, some literature always includes endpoints with zero derivative in the intervals where a function increases or decreases. It is personal preference 
      whether or not to include endpoints with zero derivative in increasing or decreasing intervals; we will choose to leave these points out. Also, because our function 
      is not differentiable when <latex>$@x \leq 0$</latex> and <latex>$@x \geq 6$</latex>, we can just assume that it is not increasing or decreasing for these values either.</s></p>
<p><s>Of course, finding increasing and decreasing intervals is not the only thing we use the derivative for. We can also use the second derivative 
      of a function to determine the concavity. Let’s see an example of using the graph of the derivative of a function to find its inflection points.</s></p>

<title>Finding the Inflection Points of a Function from the Graph of Its Derivative</title>
<question id="628140175102" instance_number="1">
<mcq>
<stem>
<p><s>The graph of the first derivative <latex>$@f@prime$</latex> of a continuous function <latex>$@f$</latex> is shown. 
              State the <latex>$@x$</latex>-coordinates of the inflection points of <latex>$@f$</latex>.</s></p><tikz scale="400" src="7.tex"/>
</stem>
</mcq>
</question>
<answer>
<p><s>In this question, we are tasked with finding the inflection points of the curve <latex>$@y = @f\left( @x \right)$</latex> and to do this we are given a 
          graph of the derivative function <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex>. We first need to recall that the inflection points are when the 
          curve changes concavity, in other words, where <latex>$@f@prime@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> changes sign. There are a few different ways to find 
          this from the given graph. The easiest way is to think about the connection between <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> and 
          <latex>$@f@prime@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex>. We know that <latex>$@f@prime@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is the derivative of 
          <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex>; in other words, <latex>$@f@prime@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is the slope of the curve of 
          <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex>.</s></p>
<p><s>We can then ask the following question: what happens when <latex>$@f@prime@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> changes sign? When 
          <latex>$@f@prime@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is positive, the slope of <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> 
          is positive, so it must be increasing. Similarly, when <latex>$@f@prime@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is negative, the slope of 
          <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is negative.</s></p>
<p><s>So, we are looking for the points on our graph where the curve switches from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.</s></p><tikz scale="400" src="8.tex"/>
<p><s>We can mark these on our graph; we can see that <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is increasing for the following values of <latex>$@x$</latex>:
 <latex>\begin{gather*} @x &lt; 2,\\
 3 &lt; @x &lt; 5,\\
 @x &gt; 7.  \end{gather*}</latex>
</s></p>
<p><s>Similarly, we can see <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is decreasing for the following values of <latex>$@x$</latex>:
 <latex>\begin{gather*} 2 &lt; @x &lt; 3,\\
 5 &lt;@x &lt; 7.  \end{gather*}</latex></s></p>
<p><s>This means <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> switches from being increasing to being decreasing when <latex>$@x =2$</latex> and <latex>$@x =4$</latex> 
   and switches from being decreasing to being increasing when <latex>$@x =3$</latex> and <latex>$@x =7$</latex>.</s></p>
<p><s>Therefore, <latex>$@f$</latex> has inflection points at <latex>$@x =2$</latex>, <latex>$@x =3$</latex>, <latex>$@x =5$</latex>, and <latex>$@x =7$</latex>.</s></p>
</answer>
</example>
<p><s>We have also seen how to use the first derivative test to determine whether local extrema are maxima or minima. For example, consider the following graph.</s></p>
<tikz scale="400" src="9.tex"/>
<p><s>We can mark the local extrema as shown, and we can determine their types by considering the slope around these points.</s></p><tikz scale="400" src="10.tex"/>
<p><s>At a local maximum of a differentiable function, the slope changes from positive to negative. At a local minimum of a differentiable function, the slope  
      changes from negative to positive. This gives us a method for checking the type of extremum when we know the derivative function <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex>. 
      However, we can use exactly the same reasoning if we are instead given the curve <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex>. Let us see this in an example.</s></p>

</question>
<answer>
<p><s>In this question, we are given a graph of <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> and we are asked to determine all the values of 
          <latex>$@x$</latex>, where the function <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> has a local extremum. To do this, we need to remember that local extrema must 
          always occur at the critical points of our function, that is, when the derivative is equal to zero or does not exist. In our case, we can see that 
          <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right) =0$</latex>, when its curve intersects the <latex>$@x$</latex>-axis.</s></p><tikz scale="400" src="12.tex"/>
<p><s>So, we have two critical points for our function <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex>, one at <latex>$@x = 1$</latex> and the other at <latex>$@x = 5$</latex>.</s></p>
<p><s>However, we are not done. We still need to check the types of point we have. Since we have a graph of <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex>, 
          we will do this by using the first derivative test.</s></p><tikz scale="400" src="13.tex"/>
<p><s>Remember, <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> tells us the slope of the curve <latex>$@y = @f\left( @x \right)$</latex>. So, when 
  <latex>$@f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex> is positive, we know the slope of <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> is positive and the same is true in reverse.</s></p>
<p><s>By looking at our graph, we can see that
<ul>
<li>when <latex>$@x &lt; 1$</latex>, <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> has a negative slope;</li>
<li>when <latex>$1 &lt; @x &lt; 5$</latex>, <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> has a positive slope.</li>
</ul></s></p>
<p><s>The first derivative test then tells us we must have a local minimum at <latex>$@x = 1$</latex>.</s></p>
<p><s>Similarly,
<ul>
<li>when <latex>$1 &lt; @x &lt; 5$</latex>, <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> has a positive slope;</li>
<li>when <latex>$@x &gt; 5$</latex>, <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> has a negative slope.</li>
</ul></s></p>
<p><s>This time, the first derivative test then tells that <latex>$@x = 5$</latex> is a local maximum for our function <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex>.</s></p>
<p><s>By using the first derivative test graphically, we were able to show that <latex>$@f$</latex> has a local maximum at <latex>$@x = 5$</latex> and a local minimum at 
  <latex>$@x = 1$</latex>.</s></p>
</answer>
</example>
<p><s>So far, in all of our examples, we have been given a graph of the function <latex>$@y = @f@prime\left( @x \right)$</latex>. But we can also deduce a lot of 
     information from the graph of the second derivative of a function. Let us see an example of this.</s></p>

</stem>
</mcq>
</question>
<answer>
<p><s>We want to find the inflection points of the function <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex>. Remember, these are points where <latex>$@f\left( @x \right)$</latex> 
          is continuous and changes concavity, either from concave upward to concave downward or vice versa.</s></p>
<p><s>We know all points of inflection occur when <latex>$@f@prime@prime \left( @x \right) = 0$</latex> or when the second derivative does not exist. So, we can see 
          from our diagram this can only happen when <latex>$@x = 1$</latex>, <latex>$@x = 4$</latex>, or <latex>$@x = 7$</latex>.</s></p>
<p><s>However, we have only shown that our curve can have inflection points at these values of <latex>$@x$</latex>. We still need to check that these are actually 
          inflection points. To do this, we need to check if our curve changes concavity at these values of <latex>$@x$</latex>.</s></p>
<p><s>We say a curve is concave upward when its second derivative is positive and concave downward when its second derivative is negative. We are given a graph

<p><s>We can now see that when <latex>$@x = 1$</latex>, the curve <latex>$@y = @f\left( @x \right)$</latex> will change from concave downward to concave upward. 
          Similarly, when <latex>$@x = 7$</latex>, the curve <latex>$@y = @f\left( @x \right)$</latex> will change from concave upward to concave downward.

          <latex>$@x = 4$</latex>, so this is not an inflection point.</s></p>
<p><s>Therefore, we have shown there are two inflection points for the curve <latex>$@y = @f\left( @x \right)$</latex>, one when <latex>$@x = 1$</latex>

<p><s>First, remember, we say a curve is concave upward when its second derivative is positive and concave downward when its second derivative is negative.</s></p>
